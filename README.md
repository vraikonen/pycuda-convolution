# Programming CUDA to perform convolutions

These two notebooks were part of the course *High performance computing and big data* with the prof. Nicolas Courty. 

They compare the computation time of CPU and GPU, as well as show how to program CUDA within python to perform convolution on hyperspectral imagery.
